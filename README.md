# React App Template

## Description

Small web application that renders an unstyled checkbox and a label next to it, and 
based on the state of the checkbox (i.e. on or off), it displays a corresponding label.

## Purpose

The true purpose of this is to understand two things:

1. Understand Build Configuration
2. Understand Configuration and Learn Basics of Jest

The reason I'd like to accomplish the first goal is that I always use 
`create-react-app`, and I am simply curious to know how to be able to build a React 
application without said configuration.

Lastly, the reason I'd like to accomplish the second goal is that I believe leveraging
Jest could add massive value to the organization I am currently a part of.

## Building

1. Clone Repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run build`
